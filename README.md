  <strong>Viral sequences overview</strong>
  <p>Metavirome overview. (A) Total contigs (N) from the de novo assembly of 109 cocoa RNA-seq libraries, classified as Meta, Host, or Viral based on protein alignment. Host material refers to residual reads that did not map to the reference genome. (B) Alignment targets of viral contigs based on protein alignment. (C) Identity and coverage of contigs aligned to viral protein sequences. (D) Classification of known and novel viruses by family and genetic material, as characterized in the contigs. (E) Distribution of complete, fragmented, and absent viral conserved domains in the characterized sequences. (F) Nucleotide similarity of contigs within each characterized viral family.</p>
